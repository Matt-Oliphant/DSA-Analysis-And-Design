# DSA - Analysis And Design: Course Reflection

Included is the pseudocode, run-time complexities, source code, and output for Project 2.
Project 2 Description: Store data from a .csv file into a structure of choice, print all the data, and locate a passed value.

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
  * How data structures store, access, search, insert, and delete data, and how efficient it is to do so. Each data structure is useful and deciding which to use often depends run-time and space complexity.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
  * I have taken a prior course on data structures so this time around I focused on learning the ins and outs of each data structure. Data manipulation is common so it’s important to operate on the correct data. When there’s an understanding how the data is stored, it’s easy to traverse the structure and operate on the correct data.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
  * This course introduced me to hash tables and at first, I was very confused by them. I spent a lot of time studying the course material and more on the internet and now have a lot better understanding. I feel more comfortable with chaining, but understand there’s a time and a place for double hashing, linear and quadratic probing. I overcome roadblocks by separating what I know from what I think the problem is asking from me. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
  * I was able to practice more with flow charts and pseudocode, and was introduced to C++. I will consider the time and space complexity to determine the best data structure to use. I will also continue to gain a deeper understanding of a particular problem by using UML diagrams, flow charts, and pseudocode before writing source code.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  * The work on the projects evolved the way I leave comments and the way I create functions. It’s useful to create overloaded methods or constructors to provide adaptability. Writing code that that is adaptable and is properly commented usually means it more maintainable.
